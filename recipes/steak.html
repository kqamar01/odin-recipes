    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ribeye steaks (about 1 inch thick)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme, chopped</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges (for serving)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step by Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the steaks from the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature for about 30 minutes. This ensures even cooking.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li>Pat the steaks dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. This helps achieve a good sear.</li>
        <li>Rub the steaks with olive oil on both sides. Season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat a large oven-safe skillet over high heat until it's very hot. Add the steaks to the skillet and sear for 2-3 minutes on each side, until a golden-brown crust forms.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic, chopped rosemary, and thyme to the skillet. Place a tablespoon of butter on each steak.</li>
        <li>Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and cook for an additional 5-7 minutes for medium-rare, or until the steaks reach your desired level of doneness.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from the oven and transfer the steaks to a cutting board. Let them rest for 5-10 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute.</li>
        <li>Serve the steaks with lemon wedges and your favorite sides.</li>
    </ol>
