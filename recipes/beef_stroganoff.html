    <h2>Desctiption</h2>
    <p>Beef Stroganoff, a classic Russian dish, traces its origins back to the mid-19th century. Named after the Stroganov family, it typically features saut√©ed pieces of beef served in a rich, creamy sauce made with sour cream, mustard, and onions. The dish is characterized by its tender, flavorful beef and the tangy, smooth sauce, which is often served over egg noodles or rice. Beef Stroganoff is particularly popular in Russia, Eastern Europe, and the United States. Preparing this dish can be moderately difficult due to the need to achieve the perfect balance of flavors in the sauce and ensuring the beef is cooked to a tender consistency without overcooking it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb (450g) beef sirloin or tenderloin, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup (250ml) beef broth</li>
        <li>1 cup (250ml) sour cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Egg noodles or rice (for serving)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step by Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced beef to the skillet and cook until browned on all sides. Remove the beef from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the flour over the onions and garlic, stirring to combine. Cook for 1-2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour in the beef broth, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Stir in the sour cream, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and paprika. Continue to cook until the sauce is thickened and smooth.</li>
        <li>Return the browned beef to the skillet and simmer for an additional 5-7 minutes, until the beef is cooked through and tender.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped fresh parsley before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve the beef stroganoff over egg noodles or rice.</li>
